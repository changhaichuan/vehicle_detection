# A vehicle detection model
This is a submission to Unleash Live for skill assessment. Please refer to **'output video.mp4'** for results and read the **"vehicle_detection_report.pdf"** for the model algorithm and discussions on the selected model.

## Required packages
- opencv-python (4.5.5 tested)
- numpy (1.22 tested)

## Usage
1. Download the repo
2. `python3 vechicle_detection.py`

## In the end
As a person who does not have previous implementation experience with object detection and perspective transform, I was overwhelmed by the given task and I did not have a clue how to finish it. After tons of research and trial and error, I developed this vehicle detection model and summarised all my thoughts in the report. I am truly thanksful for this task because I have seen my substantial improvement on this topic within three days. I believe I can improve much faster by learning from the best if I were to get the job.
